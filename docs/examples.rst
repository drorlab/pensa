You can get familiar with the PENSA library by doing the `tutorial <https://pensa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tut-1-intro.html>`_. 
To look up a specific function, see the API documentation.

An animated version of the notebook is on `Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1difJjlcwpN-0hSmGCGrPq9Cxq5wJ7ZDa>`_.

The GitHub repository also contains `example Python scripts <https://github.com/drorlab/pensa/tree/master/scripts>`_.
We describe their usage `here <https://github.com/drorlab/pensa/tree/master/tutorial#usage-ready-scripts>`_.
