This is the hardest part but you usually only have to do it once and can then play with your data. Preprocessing can handle many common trajectory formats (as it is based on MDAnalysis) but the internal featurization (based on PyEMMA) is a bit more restrictive. For large trajectories, you might want to use the scripts provided in the PENSA repository, e.g., to run them on the computing cluster and then download the processed data.\n",
